# A Catshelter Theme for WordPress
As a school project, I'm reconstructing an old site to a newer one built with Understrap WordPress

> How to install?

First put the folder inside *WordPressInstallation/wp-content/themes* and run a `npm install`

Create a page that will be your `Homepage` and choose the template `Homepage Layout`.<br>
Then do the same with your `Blogpage` and choose the template `Blogpage Layout`.

PS. This theme has support for "Contact Form 7" And have custom styling for it!.

Hope you will enjoy the Theme!
